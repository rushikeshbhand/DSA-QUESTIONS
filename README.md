<h1> Problem Solving with Data Structures and Algorithms </h1> <br>
<i> </i>Welcome to my repository showcasing my problem-solving skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)! </i>

Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my proficiency in solving various problems using DSA concepts. By organizing and presenting my solutions here, I aim to showcase my problem-solving abilities and algorithmic thinking.

Structure
The repository is structured in a way that each problem is presented in its own folder, containing the problem statement, my solution code, and any additional resources or explanations that might be helpful.

Usage
Feel free to explore the folders and examine the solutions provided. You can use these solutions for learning purposes, to gain insights into different approaches to problem-solving, or even for interview preparation.

Tools
I primarily use Java for implementing my solutions and Eclipse as my preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

Connect
If you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn.
